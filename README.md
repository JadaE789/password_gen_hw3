# password_gen_hw3

This weeks assigment was to modify and update the starter HTML and Javascript. The first step in modifying and updating the HTML in my assignment was I created four checkboxes that allowed you to specify which specific characters and what length you wanted your password to be. When you press the generate button whatever boxes you check and whatever number you type in for the length, a password with those criteria will be created and displayed . The next piece of code I modified is where the javascript link was placed. I moved it from the head of the code down to the bottom right above the body tag. Also, took out the temp.js and add_to_page.js and created a script.js and linked it to my html. 

The most important part of this assigment was the Javscript. The starter code just gave us some of the elements we needed to have the password generator work. To start, I wanted to generate random values by using the Character sets table. These functions told the computer which exact letters and characters to include when generating password. After that I was defining and creating varaibles in order to put them in the generate password function.
